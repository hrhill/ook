OOK::Open Optimisation Kit
==========================

OOK is a library for developing optimisation algorithms.

Currently implemented optimisers are line search based methods:

- Steepest descent
- Fletcher-Reeves
- BFGS
- Newton
- LBFGS

Prerequisites
-------------

The library requires

- Boost.Test for running the test suite.
- Doxygen for building the docs.
- OpenBlas
- Blaze linear algebra

It has been tested on Suse 13.1 using

- gcc-4.8.1
- boost-1.55.0

Build and install
-----------------

To build the tests,

    > mkdir $BUILD_DIR
    > cd $BUILD_DIR
    > cmake  <path to ook dir>
    > make

To run tests,

    > make test

and also,

    > diff <(./bin/sdrive) ../ook/test/f.out && diff <(./bin/sdrive_diagco) ../ook/test/diagco_f.out

To build and view documentation,

    > make doc
    > <your browser> ./doc/html/index.html

To install,

    > sudo make install



Notes on lfbgs
---------------
C++ implementation of lbfgs. This is based on the original Fortran implementation, by first running f2c, then refactoring the code to a point where it is easier to see what is going on for a regular C++ user. The refactoring took place with some ad hoc testing which is included here. The test compares the output files generated by fortran (with a substitution of E for D) to those generated by comparable C++ programs.
